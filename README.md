Key Features:
Responsive Design:

The CSS is designed to be flexible and responsive, adjusting to various screen sizes.
Flexbox is used for the layout of sections like the projects grid and the skills list.
Contact Form with PHP Email Handling:

The contact form submits data to a send-email.php file that handles sending the email.
This backend script uses PHP’s mail() function to send an email with the form data.
Structured Sections:

The website is divided into clearly defined sections: About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact.
CSS Customization:

You can replace 'your-image-url-here' in the .hero class with the actual path to your hero image.
How to Use:
Set Up:

Save the HTML, CSS, and PHP files in your web server directory.
Update the image URL in the CSS to point to your actual hero image.
Deploy:

If you’re hosting this on a server, ensure that PHP is enabled for the email functionality to work.
Test the Form:

Submit the contact form to make sure the emails are sent correctly.
